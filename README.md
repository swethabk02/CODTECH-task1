OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Project Name: Simple Calculator 
![TASK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c71a65-90c5-4fb4-931b-2402fa8ab6bd)

OBJECTIVE:
Creating a basic calculator program aims to facilitate interactive arithmetic operations, reinforce fundamental programming concepts like input handling and conditionals, and provide practical experience in Python development for building useful computational tools.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
Key activities in creating a basic calculator program:
   1. Designing User Interface: Develop prompts for user input and display outputs clearly.
   2. Implementing Arithmetic Operations: Code functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   3. Testing and Validation: Verify the program's accuracy and usability through systematic testing of inputs and outputs.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
Here are the technologies typically used for creating a basic calculator program in Python:
 1. Python Programming Language: Main language for implementing program logic, input handling, and output display.
 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Tools like VS Code provide a robust environment for writing and debugging Python code.
 3. Terminal: Used for running Python scripts and interacting with the program.
